#### More information (if you actually care to read...)
I live in Brooklyn, and my favorite spots on the world wide internets include [Kitty Ipsum](http://kittyipsum.com/), [Github](http://github.com) and [my lame blog](http://carlvlewis.net). I'm a member of [CSV Soundsystem](http://csvsoundsystem.org), [Online News Association](http://journalists.org) and more. I'm a cartography nerd, and want to write my last will and testament in [Markdown](http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/). I [tweet](http://twitter.com/carlvlewis) way too often, and [Instagram](http://instagram.com/carlvlewis) almost every day.

I earned my M.S. in Digital Media and Information Design from [Columbia University Graduate School of Journalism](http://jrn.columbia.edu), but my heart will always lie with my undergraduate institution, [Mercer University](http://mercer.edu). After quitting my job at [Morning News Media](http://dosavannah.com), I launched my startup [borrow.ly](http://staging.borrowly.com), but recently have been feeling compelled to re-enter the  data visualization field. 

If you want to know more, shoot me an email at carl@carlvlewis.net or connect with me on [LinkedIn](http://linkedin.com/in/carlvlewis).
