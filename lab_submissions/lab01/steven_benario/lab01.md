##Hello there!
I'm Steven Benario, and this is my first markdown file.

###What I do
I'm a Product Manager at [Ufora](http://www.ufora.com). We make a modern, distributed platform for data scientists that allows them to work faster, and with more data than they could otherwise. 

*Imagine the ease of working with a single machine, and the power of an entire cluster. **That's Ufora**.*

###My Coding Background
I don't know how to code.
I'm pretty good with computers though, so I usually figure stuff out pretty quickly.

###A Blog Post
Well, recently I read [this post](http://mlwave.com/reflecting-back-on-one-year-of-kaggle-contests/) about reflecting on a year of Kaggle competitions. *Unfortunately, not quite as enlightening as I had hoped...*
