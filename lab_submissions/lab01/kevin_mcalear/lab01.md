###Your name and what you do:

Hello! My Name is Kevin McAlear.


###One liner about your coding and math background:

I am currently a full-stack web developer at a startup. I will probably be stronger at programming than the math. If you need help with programming I may need help with some of the harder math at first. :) Also, that is two (now three) lines.
